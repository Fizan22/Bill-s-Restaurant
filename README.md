# Bill-s-Restaurant
Simple ordering service in which a made up person called Bill can take your order and end up giving your final Bill which pops up on the screen. 
This Java project is a simple project I made to practice and improve my OOP skills. It takes the order you want by simple use of JOptionPane to get inputs and show messages. I used this instead of the Scanner Class as I did not want to use the console. It has errors in which I did not work to improve as of yet. Will improve as I improve my skills and understanding of Java.
